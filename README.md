## Building

In order to get a running debian-bootc system you can run the following steps:
```shell
just build-containerfile # This will build the containerfile and all the dependencies you need
just generate-bootable-image # Generates a bootable image for you using bootc!
```

Then you can run the `bootable.img` as your boot disk in your preferred hypervisor.

## Notes

For Debian Stable, please take a look at <https://github.com/linuxsnow/debian-bootc-core> or pull request workflows in order to make it work in this repo. Thank you!
